<h1>Hello, I'm bench245</h1>
<p>This is my website where I'm going to be putting stuff.</p>
<p>I'm currently working on two different minecraft maps and learning GLSL so that I can make minecraft shaders</p>
<p>(It should be quite obvious but I'm also learning to make my own website) </p>

<p>A revolver model for an upcoming map</p>

<p>My Minecraft skin</p>
<img src="/images/skin.png" alt="A Minecraft skin">
<p>I'll find a better place to put stuff like this later, for now I'm just trying to get it working </p>
